# Object Oriented Cash Register

## Objectives

1. Build a class with instance methods.
2. Call instance methods inside of other instance methods.
3. Use instance methods to track information pertinent to an instance of a class.

## Description

We're going to create an Object Oriented Cash Register that can:
* Add items of varying quantities and prices
* Calculate discounts
* Keep track of what's been added to it
* Void the last transaction

## Instructions

**This is a test-driven lab!** You will need to read the spec file and the test output very carefully to solve this one.

**Hint #1:** Keep in mind that to call an instance method *inside* another instance method, we use the `self` keyword to refer to the instance on which we are operating. For example:

```ruby
class Person

  attr_accessor :age

  def initialize(age)
    @age = 0
  end

  def birthday
    self.age += 1
  end
end
```

Follow along with the specs in `spec/cash_register_spec.rb`. Reading along with what the tests are looking for can be really helpful!

Take it one step at a time!



**Hint #2:** The `void_last_transaction` method will remove the last transaction from the total. You'll need to make an additional attribute accessor and keep track of that last transaction amount somehow. Also you have to make sure that you have updated the items in the cashier to reflect the void operation. In what method of the class are you working with an individual item?
